APIs and Web Services

Course Prerequisites
Before we start building APIs, let’s take a moment to set you up for success. This course is designed to give you a strong foundation in APIs and web services, but having a few key skills under your belt will make your learning experience smoother and more enjoyable.

Python Fundamentals
At a minimum, you should be comfortable with Python. Since we’ll be using Flask to build and interact with APIs, you’ll need to understand basic programming concepts such as:

Writing functions
Working with data structures like dictionaries and lists
Handling control flow with loops and conditionals
You don’t need to be a Python expert, but having familiarity with these core concepts will help you focus on learning how APIs work rather than getting stuck on syntax.

Understanding How the Web Works
Since APIs operate over HTTP, knowing a bit about HTTP requests and responses will be useful. For example, when you enter a URL in your browser, it sends an HTTP request, and the server sends back a response. 

In this course, we’ll work with different HTTP methods, including:

GET – retrieve data
POST – send new data
PUT – update existing data
DELETE – remove data
We’ll also talk about status codes, such as:

200 – success
404 – not Found 
Understanding how web applications communicate will give you a head start.

Prior API Experience (Not Required, but Helpful)
You don’t need experience working with APIs, but if you’ve ever used a third-party service that connects to an application—like integrating a payment processor, signing in with Google, or fetching weather data from an online service—you already have some exposure to how APIs work. In this course, we’ll go deeper, covering how to use APIs and build your own.

Working with the Command Line
You should be comfortable working with the command line and installing Python packages. Since we’ll be using Flask, Postman, and other tools throughout the course, it will be helpful to:

Install dependencies using pip
Run applications from the terminal
Navigate directories and execute basic commands
GitHub Codespaces
Throughout this course, we’ll use GitHub Codespaces, a cloud-hosted development environment that allows you to code directly from your browser—no local setup required.
To get started, navigate to the course’s GitHub repository, where you’ll find a README file with key information and various exercise files. Each lesson has an associated file, and you can open any file by clicking on its name.
There are two ways to access GitHub Codespaces:

In the GitHub repository, look for the "Code" button in the top right corner.
If you’re on the Local tab, switch to the Codespaces tab.
From there, you can either start a new Codespace on the main branch or resume work in an existing one. Keep in mind that launching a Codespace for the first time may take a little longer, but once it's set up, future loads will be much faster.
Once inside GitHub Codespaces, you’ll have a navigation menu on the left that lets you quickly access files, making it easy to follow along with the course exercises.

Preparing for Success
If any of these areas feel new to you, don’t stress—I’ll explain what you need along the way. The most important thing is being willing to experiment, build, and troubleshoot as you go. By the end of this course, you’ll have the confidence to work with APIs, whether you’re integrating existing ones or building your own from scratch.

Now that you know what to expect, let’s dive in and start building!
